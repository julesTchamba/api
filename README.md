# 3Rivers Developer Interview "Assignment"

Hello and welcome to the developer challenge for microservices developer role on the 3rivers project. In our project we are writing spring boot APIs that each serve a given BIAN Service Domain. The data that the APIs exposed are sourced from Systems of Record to produce a realtime feed through Kafka. Our APIs are either written on top of Kafka topics directly using Event Sourcing or we use the traditional approach of sinking our data from Kafka to a database and write our API on of of the databases.

The purpose of this challenge is to have you work through a problem where the expectation is for you to produce an API. We have specifically opted to make the problem statement as generic as possible to allow you to:

Show us your thought process and creativity. That way the interview is fun.
Flex your technical muscles as much as you want on us.
Not get bored.

1. Show us your thought process and creativity. That way the interview is fun
